# VS CODE
I've created a VS Code project using Node.js's FileSystem (fs) module to implement CRUD operations.
The application allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete files. 
It provides a simple yet effective way to manage data through the file system,
making it easy to interact with and manipulate files programmatically.
